                        Its aim is to deliver groceries directly to user’s home within minutes and at supermarket

                        Each team member designed the initial sketch by himself/herself, in order to reflect as wide a
                        variety of screens and layouts as possible to get the ideas flowing.

                            navigating through the app. Please ignore if the grocery product information is incorrect or

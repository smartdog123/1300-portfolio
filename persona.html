                        these individuals about their experiences, create personas based on these users, and illustrate a
                        storyboard for one of the personas.

                        The interface of microwave is showing on the right of the machine. There are four parts. The
                        topmost one is a screen displaying the current state. The second one is used for different
                        cooking mode (popcorn, beverage, etc.). The third one is used to set cooking time. And the
                        bottom one is used for features of the microwave (cook time, steam clean, etc.). There are
                        buttons for microwave settings. To open the microwave door, the user uses the handle on the
                        door.

                    <strong>Observation:</strong> He opened the refrigerator and grabbed out the frozen food. He opened
                    the microwave door and placed food in the center of microwave dish, and closed the door. He pressed
                    “5” on the “express cook” shortcut button, and went to work on his homework. After five minutes, he
                    checked the food, and he thought it was not cooked enough, so he added 2 minutes cooking time.

                    <strong>Observation:</strong> He grabbed a bag of microwave popcorn and placed food in the center of
                    microwave dish. He pressed “Popcorn” on the cooking mode part, and the microwave just started
                    without asking for cook time. Since he didn’t know how to set the cooking time for the Popcorn mode,
                    he had to stand there waiting until he thinks the popcorn is ready. When there were little “pop”
                    sound in the microwave, he believed it was fully cooked and grabbed the popcorn out.

                    5:30, and pressed the “start” button. Then she worked on making a salad for her children while the
                    microwave was working. After she heard the “beep” sound from the microwave, she opened it, and the
                    food was just well heated.

                            The three interviewees all said because the microwave is a fast and convenient cooking
                            method. It doesn’t require you preheat. And you can just grab the food, put it in a bowl or
                            on a plate, place it on the microwave dish, and it is ready to be heated. It is fast
                            compared to an oven or a steamer, which requires preheat and should be careful while using.
                            Although the interviewees are a little overwhelmed by lots of buttons on the interface, they
                            could accept that.

                            The three interviewees all said they are a little overwhelmed by so much buttons on the
                            interface, but they got more comfortable after taking a look into each one, since the name
                            of each button indicate what they are used for. They expect the microwave to be an
                            all-purpose one.

                            Both Barry and Melinda use the normal cooking mode the most. Barry loves to use the “express
                            cook” shortcut button on the interface, since it just require one press to set the cooking
                            time and start cooking. Melinda usually set the cooking time manually, since she thinks this
                            give her more precise control of how long the food is cooked, and she is experienced with
                            the cooking time. James uses the “Popcorn” and “Potato” cooking mode the most since he
                            mainly prepare popcorn and French fries using microwave.

                            The three interviewees all said they are not quite sure of how to use some features. Here

                            <br>
                            Defrost: it requires user to input the weight of the food, but they don’t have kitchen
                            scale.
                            <br>
                            Steam Clean: they don’t know how it works, and there are no instructions, and they are
                            afraid that the steam might short-circuit some electronics component.
                            <br>
                            Power Level: when it is pressed, the screen just shows “cannot set power level at this
                            time”, but doesn’t say when can the user set that.
                            <br>
                            Reset filter: they don’t know how it works.
                            <br>
                            Set Clock: they don’t know how it works.

                        <p class="mb-3">
                            James never figured out how to set the cook time for special cooking modes(Popcorn,
                            Beverage, etc.), and he had to wait in front of the microwave till he thinks the food is
                            ready, this is inconvenient for him. Barry and Melinda mainly stick to some specific
                            settings, and they think it is hard to try other features since there are not enough
                            instructions.

                        <strong>Description of the user:</strong> This is a persona describing a typical student at
                        University with a lot
                        of coursework or taking a part-time job. He would like to microwave some frozen food since he
                        does not have enough time to cook for himself during the week. On his spare time, he love to
                        have popcorn or French fries which can be quickly cooked as well.

                        <strong>Interface problem:</strong> He doesn’t have much experience on how long different food
                        should be cooked,
                        so he has to set an estimated time, then come and check whether the food is fully cooked. In
                        addition, when he want to have popcorn or French fries, he has to wait in front of the microwave
                        till he thinks they are ready.

                        like popcorn, potato, etc. So it is suitable for describing a student using microwave.

                        <strong>Description of the user:</strong> This is a persona describing a typical woman with work
                        and a family. She would like to use microwave to reheat some leftovers. She wants more precise
                        control of the cook time.

                    <p class="mb-4 my-intro-text">
                        <strong>Interface problem:</strong> Since she wants more precise control of the cook time, she
                        has to make several presses to start cooking. In addition, she doesn’t use internet to search
                        pretty much, so those buttons without instructions are hard for her.

                        <strong>Reasons behind the persona:</strong> The persona represents how people with family would
                        use the microwave. Since leftovers are common in families, reheating them is a common use case.
                        Also, because people have a busy time working and taking care of their families, they don’t use
                        internet very much, thus learning how to use some buttons become time-consuming for them.
                        Therefore, this persona is representative enough.
